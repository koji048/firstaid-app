```

Current navigation files [Source: Project structure]:
- `/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` - Root navigation container
- `/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx` - Main tab navigator
- `/src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx` - Authentication stack
- `/src/navigation/stacks/HomeNavigator.tsx` - Home stack
- `/src/navigation/stacks/GuidesNavigator.tsx` - Guides stack  
- `/src/navigation/stacks/MedicalNavigator.tsx` - Medical stack
- `/src/navigation/stacks/SettingsNavigator.tsx` - Settings stack
- `/src/navigation/types.ts` - Navigation type definitions

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6
- **Framework**: React Native 0.73+
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3+
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit 2.0+
- **UI Library**: React Native Elements 4.0+

### Home Screen Requirements

Current HomeScreen location: `/src/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx` [Source: Project structure]

Quick actions should include:
- Emergency mode toggle with prominent placement
- Quick access to emergency contacts
- First aid guides search/browse entry point
- Medical profile quick access
- Emergency services button (always visible per AC 3)

### Emergency Button Integration

Based on emergency components established [Source: Project structure]:
- EmergencyServicesButton exists at `/src/components/emergency/EmergencyServicesButton/`
- EmergencyModeToggle exists at `/src/components/emergency/EmergencyModeToggle/`
- Emergency button must be accessible from all screens (AC 3)

### UI Design Requirements

Based on UI Guidelines [Source: architecture/ui-guideline.md]:

- **Design Philosophy**: IBM minimal design with sharp corners, generous spacing
- **Colors**: 
  - Primary: `--ibm-blue: #0f62fe` for navigation elements
  - Emergency: `--ibm-error: #da1e28` for emergency buttons
  - Text: `--ibm-text-primary: #161616` for main content
- **Spacing**: `px-12 py-8` mobile, `px-16 py-12` desktop
- **Typography**: IBM Plex Sans font family, light weights for headers
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 56x56dp for accessibility
- **Sharp Corners**: No rounded corners throughout

### Bottom Tab Configuration

Navigation tabs should include:
1. **Home** - Quick actions and emergency access
2. **Guides** - First aid guides and search
3. **Medical** - Medical profile and information
4. **Settings** - App settings and profile

Tab icons should follow IBM design principles with sharp, minimal styling.

### Accessibility Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-guideline.md#accessibility]:
- WCAG AA compliance minimum
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- Screen reader support with descriptive labels
- High contrast mode support
- Minimum touch targets 56x56dp
- Clear focus indicators (2px solid outline)

### State Management Integration

Redux store structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]:

```typescript
interface AppState {
  auth: {
    user: User | null;
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
    tokens: AuthTokens | null;
  };
  emergency: {
    contacts: EmergencyContact[];
    primaryContact: EmergencyContact | null;
    isEmergencyMode: boolean;
    nearbyHospitals: Hospital[];
  };
  guides: {
    guides: FirstAidGuide[];
    currentGuide: FirstAidGuide | null;
    bookmarks: string[];
    downloadedGuides: string[];
  };
}
```

Navigation should respect emergency mode state and adapt UI accordingly.

### Component Organization

Navigation components location [Source: Project structure]:
- Tab navigator: `/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`
- Stack navigators: `/src/navigation/stacks/`
- Navigation types: `/src/navigation/types.ts`

Home screen components needed:
- QuickActionsBar (may exist at `/src/components/guides/QuickActionsBar/`)
- Emergency quick access components

### Performance Requirements

[Source: Epic success metrics]:
- Screen transitions must be smooth and responsive
- Navigation changes should complete within 300ms
- Emergency button must be accessible within 2 seconds from any screen

### Platform Considerations

## Notes

This story implements the core navigation foundation for the First Aid Room App, establishing intuitive user flows with special attention to emergency access patterns. The implementation must prioritize accessibility and performance while maintaining the IBM design system aesthetic established in previous stories.

The navigation system should seamlessly integrate with the emergency mode functionality from Story 1.9, ensuring users can always access critical emergency features regardless of their current location in the app. All navigation elements must be properly tested for accessibility compliance and cross-platform consistency.

Since this is a foundational story affecting the entire app experience, extra attention should be paid to performance optimization, smooth transitions, and comprehensive testing across different devices and accessibility tools.
