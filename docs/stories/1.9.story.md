## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.8 implementation:

- Emergency dial button pattern established in GuideDetailScreen
- High contrast mode and emergency-optimized UI patterns
- Large touch targets (56x56dp) for emergency actions
- Confirmation modal pattern for emergency dialing
- Haptic feedback for critical actions implemented
- Redux state management for emergency mode
- IBM design philosophy (sharp corners, generous spacing)

### Location Service Infrastructure

Existing location service at `/src/services/location.ts` [Source: Project structure]:
- Should be reviewed and potentially enhanced for emergency use
- May need to integrate with React Native Geolocation API
- Consider battery-efficient location tracking

### Phone Service Infrastructure  

Existing phone service at `/src/services/phone.ts` [Source: Project structure]:
- Likely contains dialing functionality
- Should be enhanced for emergency services
- Platform-specific handling may already be implemented

### Emergency State Management

From Redux store structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]:

```typescript
emergency: {
  contacts: EmergencyContact[];
  primaryContact: EmergencyContact | null;
  isEmergencyMode: boolean;
  nearbyHospitals: Hospital[];
}
```

- `isEmergencyMode` already tracked in state
- `nearbyHospitals` array prepared for hospital data
- Emergency slice exists at `/src/store/slices/emergencySlice.ts`

### UI Design Requirements

Based on UI Guidelines [Source: architecture/ui-guideline.md]:

- Sharp corners (no rounded corners)
- Generous spacing: `px-12 py-8` mobile, `px-16 py-12` desktop
- Emergency status colors: `--ibm-error: #da1e28`
- Large touch targets for emergency use (56x56dp minimum)
- High contrast text (WCAG AAA - 7:1 ratio)
- Minimal color usage - red for emergency emphasis only

### Emergency Screen Location

Based on navigation structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]:

```
HomeStack
├── HomeScreen
└── EmergencyModeScreen
```

EmergencyModeScreen already exists at `/src/screens/EmergencyModeScreen.tsx` [Source: Project structure]

### Component Organization

Emergency components should be in `/src/components/emergency/` [Source: Project structure]:

Existing components:
- CallConfirmationModal - for call confirmations
- EmergencyModeToggle - for toggling emergency mode
- LocationShareToggle - for location sharing
- QuickDialButton - for quick dialing

New components may need to be created:
- EmergencyServicesButton
- LocationDisplay
- NearbyHospitalsList

### Platform-Specific Implementation

React Native platform-specific code patterns:
- Use `Platform.OS === 'ios'` or `Platform.OS === 'android'`
- Platform-specific file extensions: `.ios.ts` and `.android.ts`
- Location permissions differ between platforms
- Phone call handling may vary

### External API Integration

From external APIs documentation [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#google-maps-api]:

- Google Maps API for finding nearby hospitals
- Endpoint: `GET /place/nearbysearch` 
- Implement caching for common locations
- Fallback to offline data when unavailable

### Security and Privacy Considerations

- Location data is sensitive - only request when needed
- Clear permission explanations required
- No location data should be stored without user consent
- Emergency calls should bypass normal confirmation in true emergency mode

### Accessibility Requirements

- Emergency button must be easily discoverable
- Screen reader must announce emergency features prominently  
- Minimum touch target 56x56dp for all emergency actions
- High contrast mode support throughout
- Voice control for hands-free emergency activation (future)

### Performance Considerations

- Emergency features must respond in < 2 seconds [Source: Epic success metrics]
- Location detection should not block UI
- Implement timeout for location services with fallback
- Cache nearby hospitals data when possible

## Notes

This story implements critical emergency features that must be reliable and fast. The focus is on one-tap access to emergency services with clear UI indicators and robust fallback options. All emergency features must work offline where possible, with graceful degradation when services are unavailable.

The implementation should leverage existing components and patterns established in previous stories, particularly the emergency UI patterns from Story 1.8. Platform-specific code should be carefully tested on actual devices.

Since this is a critical safety feature, extra attention should be paid to error handling, offline functionality, and accessibility to ensure the feature works when users need it most.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation** that successfully delivers all core emergency services functionality. The codebase demonstrates strong architectural decisions, comprehensive error handling, and proper separation of concerns. Platform-specific implementations are well-structured with clear fallbacks for development environments. Component design follows React Native best practices with proper memoization and accessibility support.

Key strengths:
- Well-structured service layer with clear interfaces
- Comprehensive test coverage across components and services
- Proper platform-specific implementations with intelligent fallbacks
- Strong error handling and user feedback mechanisms
