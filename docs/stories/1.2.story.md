5. Migration strategy for future updates
6. Unit tests for all data operations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 implementation:

- Redux Toolkit store is configured with TypeScript support at `/src/store/store.ts`
- Type-safe Redux hooks available at `/src/store/hooks.ts`
- AsyncStorage is already installed and configured
- Storage service abstraction exists at `/src/storage/StorageService.ts`
- Test utilities configured at `/src/utils/test/test-utils.tsx`

### Data Models

Based on the EmergencyContact model from architecture [Source: architecture/data-models.md#emergencycontact-model]:

```typescript
interface EmergencyContact {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  relationship: ContactRelationship;
  category: ContactCategory;
  isPrimary: boolean;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum ContactRelationship {
  SPOUSE = 'spouse',
  PARENT = 'parent',
  CHILD = 'child',
  SIBLING = 'sibling',
  FRIEND = 'friend',
  DOCTOR = 'doctor',
  OTHER = 'other',
}

enum ContactCategory {
  FAMILY = 'family',
  MEDICAL = 'medical',
  WORK = 'work',
  OTHER = 'other',
}
```

**Database Schema Reference** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#emergency-contacts]:

- Table: `emergency_contacts`
- Key fields: id (UUID), user_id, name, phone, relationship, category, is_primary, notes
- Indexes: idx_user_primary for fast primary contact lookup

### Storage Architecture

From the frontend architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]:

- AsyncStorage is used for persistent local storage
- Emergency contacts must be cached for offline access
- Storage pattern example shows caching in EmergencyService with key `CONTACTS_CACHE_KEY`
- Data must be JSON serialized/deserialized for AsyncStorage

### File Locations

Based on the unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Redux slice: `/src/store/slices/emergencyContactsSlice.ts` (new file)
- Storage service: `/src/storage/emergencyContactsStorage.ts` (new file)
- Types: `/src/types/emergencyContact.ts` (new file)
- Tests: `/__tests__/store/slices/emergencyContactsSlice.test.ts` (new file)
- Tests: `/__tests__/storage/emergencyContactsStorage.test.ts` (new file)

### Technical Requirements

**Encryption Requirements**:

- Since this is sensitive medical data, implement encryption for stored contacts
- Use a secure encryption library compatible with React Native
- Store encryption keys securely using device keychain

**Storage Keys**:

- Use prefix pattern for AsyncStorage keys: `@firstaid:emergency_contacts:{userId}`
- Version storage format for migration support: `@firstaid:emergency_contacts:version`

**Migration Strategy**:

- Implement versioned storage with migration functions
- Current version: 1
- Migration registry pattern for future updates

### Redux State Management

Based on existing Redux patterns from Story 1.1:

- Create feature slice using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`
- Follow the pattern established in existing slices (authSlice, guidesSlice, etc.)
- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous actions
- Use normalized state shape for contacts (object keyed by ID)

### Testing Requirements

From the testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Unit tests location: `/__tests__/store/slices/` for Redux logic
- Unit tests location: `/__tests__/storage/` for storage operations
- Use Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Test patterns:
  - Test all CRUD operations
  - Test encryption/decryption
  - Test migration logic
  - Test error handling
  - Mock AsyncStorage using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage/jest/async-storage-mock`

### Performance Considerations

- Implement batch operations for multiple contact updates
- Use memoized selectors for contact queries
- Limit encrypted data size for performance
- Consider pagination if user has many contacts (though unlikely for emergency contacts)

- Storage must be versioned for future migrations

## Notes

This story focuses purely on the data layer - no UI implementation. The UI will be implemented in Story 1.3. Ensure all data operations are thoroughly tested as they form the foundation for emergency contact features.

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with well-structured TypeScript types, proper Redux Toolkit patterns, and comprehensive error handling. The code follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns between types, state management, storage, and encryption services. The use of normalized state structure in Redux is particularly well done, enabling efficient updates and queries.

- Encryption keys securely stored in device keychain with proper access controls
- Keychain access set to WHEN_UNLOCKED for appropriate security
- Proper error handling prevents data leakage on decryption failures
- Automatic cleanup of corrupted encrypted data

### Performance Considerations

Performance optimizations are well implemented:
- Normalized Redux state structure for O(1) lookups

- Batch operations supported in storage layer
- Efficient encryption targeting only sensitive fields
- Proper use of async/await for non-blocking operations

### Final Status

[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]

The implementation exceeds expectations with robust security, excellent code organization, and comprehensive testing. The developer has successfully created a secure, performant, and maintainable data layer for emergency contacts that will serve as a solid foundation for the UI implementation in Story 1.3.
