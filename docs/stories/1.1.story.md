# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Architecture

## Story Information

**Epic**: 1 - MVP Core Features  
**Story Number**: 1.1  
**Title**: Project Setup and Architecture  
**Status**: Done

## Story Statement

**As a** development team,  
**I want** to set up the project infrastructure and architecture,  
**So that** we have a solid foundation for building the MVP features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native project initialized with TypeScript support
2. Development environment setup for iOS and Android
3. Basic project structure following architecture guidelines
4. CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions
5. Code quality tools configured (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
6. Basic README with setup instructions

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack Requirements

Based on the architecture documentation, the following technical stack must be implemented:

#### Frontend Stack [Source: architecture.md#technical-stack]

- **Framework**: React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for application state
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Offline Storage**: AsyncStorage and SQLite

#### Infrastructure and DevOps [Source: architecture.md#infrastructure]

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and Sentry setup preparation
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub

#### Architecture Patterns [Source: architecture.md#architecture-patterns]

The mobile application must follow a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and screens
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Redux actions and reducers
3. **Data Access Layer**: API clients and local storage
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Platform-specific implementations

### Project Structure Requirements

Since no specific unified project structure document was found in the architecture docs, the structure should follow React Native best practices and the layered architecture pattern described above.

Suggested directory structure based on architecture patterns:

```
firstaid-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── screens/          # Screen components (Presentation Layer)
│   ├── navigation/       # Navigation configuration
│   ├── store/           # Redux store, actions, reducers (Business Logic Layer)
│   ├── services/        # API clients and external services (Data Access Layer)
│   ├── storage/         # Local storage implementations (Data Access Layer)
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
│   └── platform/        # Platform-specific code (Infrastructure Layer)
├── android/             # Android-specific code
├── ios/                # iOS-specific code
├── __tests__/          # Test files
└── .github/            # GitHub Actions workflows
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the project setup and architecture. The developer has successfully established a solid foundation following React Native best practices with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and proper layered architecture. The code is well-structured, type-safe, and follows modern patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/src/components/common/ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

  - **Change**: Added Sentry integration for error tracking
  - **Why**: The component had a TODO comment indicating Sentry should be integrated
  - **How**: Imported captureException from the Sentry service and properly sends errors with context

- **File**: `/index.js`
  - **Change**: Added Sentry initialization before app starts
  - **Why**: Error monitoring must be initialized at app startup to catch all errors
  - **How**: Imported initSentry and called it before registering the app component

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode enabled, ESLint and Prettier configured
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows layered architecture pattern as specified in Dev Notes
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Jest and React Native Testing Library configured with examples
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Integrated Sentry error tracking in ErrorBoundary component
- [x] Added Sentry initialization at app startup
- [ ] Consider adding environment variable validation for Sentry DSN
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for navigation flows
- [ ] Consider implementing a logger service for development debugging

### Security Review

Good security practices observed:

- Sentry configured to filter sensitive user information
- Environment-based configuration for API endpoints
- No hardcoded secrets found in the codebase

### Performance Considerations

- Bundle size optimization configured in Metro bundler
- Code splitting preparation in place for future feature modules
- Flipper integration ready for performance debugging
- React DevTools configured for development optimization

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The project setup story has been implemented exceptionally well. The foundation is solid, follows best practices, and provides excellent patterns for future development. All acceptance criteria are met, and the minor improvements suggested above can be addressed in future stories as needed.
