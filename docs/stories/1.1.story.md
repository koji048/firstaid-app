# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Architecture

## Story Information

**Epic**: 1 - MVP Core Features  
**Story Number**: 1.1  
**Title**: Project Setup and Architecture  
**Status**: Draft  

## Story Statement

**As a** development team,  
**I want** to set up the project infrastructure and architecture,  
**So that** we have a solid foundation for building the MVP features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native project initialized with TypeScript support
2. Development environment setup for iOS and Android
3. Basic project structure following architecture guidelines
4. CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions
5. Code quality tools configured (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
6. Basic README with setup instructions

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack Requirements

Based on the architecture documentation, the following technical stack must be implemented:

#### Frontend Stack [Source: architecture.md#technical-stack]
- **Framework**: React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for application state
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Offline Storage**: AsyncStorage and SQLite

#### Infrastructure and DevOps [Source: architecture.md#infrastructure]
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and Sentry setup preparation
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub

#### Architecture Patterns [Source: architecture.md#architecture-patterns]

The mobile application must follow a layered architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and screens
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Redux actions and reducers
3. **Data Access Layer**: API clients and local storage
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Platform-specific implementations

### Project Structure Requirements

Since no specific unified project structure document was found in the architecture docs, the structure should follow React Native best practices and the layered architecture pattern described above.

Suggested directory structure based on architecture patterns:
```
firstaid-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── screens/          # Screen components (Presentation Layer)
│   ├── navigation/       # Navigation configuration
│   ├── store/           # Redux store, actions, reducers (Business Logic Layer)
│   ├── services/        # API clients and external services (Data Access Layer)
│   ├── storage/         # Local storage implementations (Data Access Layer)
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
│   └── platform/        # Platform-specific code (Infrastructure Layer)
├── android/             # Android-specific code
├── ios/                # iOS-specific code
├── __tests__/          # Test files
└── .github/            # GitHub Actions workflows
```

### Performance Requirements [Source: architecture.md#mobile-performance]
- **Bundle Size**: Target < 20MB initial download
- **Code Splitting**: Prepare for lazy loading of features
- **App Launch Time**: Must support < 2 seconds launch time (from Epic requirements)

### Development Environment Requirements [Source: architecture.md#development-environment]
- Local development setup
- Automated testing pipeline preparation
- Feature branch deployment capability preparation

### Platform Requirements
Based on Epic 1 technical specifications:

- TypeScript support
- iOS 13+
- Android 8+

### Code Quality Requirements
From the acceptance criteria:
- ESLint configuration for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
