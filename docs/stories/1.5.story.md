## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4 implementation:
- Redux state management patterns are well established with Redux Toolkit 2.0+
- TypeScript interfaces are defined in `/src/types/index.ts` 
- Storage service is available at `/src/storage/StorageService.ts` using AsyncStorage
- Redux store slices are organized in `/src/store/slices/`
- The app follows a feature-based component organization in `/src/components/`
- Testing patterns established using Jest and React Native Testing Library

### Data Models

FirstAidGuide model already defined [Source: /src/types/index.ts#31-45]:
```typescript
interface FirstAidGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  summary: string;
  content: GuideContent;
  searchTags: string[];
  version: number;
  isOfflineAvailable: boolean;
  viewCount: number;
  lastReviewedAt?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

GuideContent structure [Source: /src/types/index.ts#47-52]:
```typescript
interface GuideContent {
  steps: GuideStep[];
  warnings?: string[];
  whenToSeekHelp?: string[];
  preventionTips?: string[];
}
```

GuideStep structure [Source: /src/types/index.ts#54-61]:
```typescript
interface GuideStep {
  order: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  videoUrl?: string;
  duration?: number;
}
```

### Redux State Management

Guides Redux slice already exists [Source: /src/store/slices/guidesSlice.ts]:
- State includes: guides array, currentGuide, bookmarks, downloadedGuides, searchQuery, selectedCategory
- Actions available: setGuides, setCurrentGuide, addBookmark, removeBookmark, markAsDownloaded, setSearchQuery, setSelectedCategory

### Storage Architecture

Based on existing patterns:
- Storage service uses AsyncStorage [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#14]
- Encryption service available at `/src/services/encryption.ts` for sensitive data
- Migration strategy established at `/src/storage/migrations/index.ts`

### Content Structure Requirements

JSON-based content structure for guides should include:
- Versioning support for content updates
- Media asset references (images, videos)
- Search-optimized metadata
- Offline availability flags
- Medical accuracy review timestamps

### Guide Categories

Common first aid categories to support:
- Basic Life Support (CPR, choking, etc.)
- Wounds and Bleeding
- Burns and Scalds
- Fractures and Sprains
- Medical Emergencies (heart attack, stroke, etc.)
- Environmental Emergencies (heat stroke, hypothermia)
- Poisoning and Overdose
- Pediatric Emergencies

### File Locations

New files should be created at:
- `/src/services/guideContentService.ts` - Guide content management service
- `/src/utils/guideValidator.ts` - Content validation utilities
- `/src/utils/searchIndexer.ts` - Search indexing utilities
- `/src/storage/guidesStorage.ts` - Guide-specific storage operations
- `/src/types/guideContent.ts` - Extended guide content types

Modified files:
- `/src/store/slices/guidesSlice.ts` - Add content management actions
- `/src/types/index.ts` - May need to extend guide types

### Technical Constraints

## Notes

This story establishes the foundation for managing first aid guide content. The system must support offline access, versioning for updates, and efficient searching. All content will be bundled with the app for the MVP, with future stories potentially adding dynamic content updates. The content structure should be flexible enough to support various media types and guide complexity levels while maintaining fast search performance.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully delivers a comprehensive guide content management system with strong architecture and good separation of concerns. The code demonstrates solid TypeScript practices, proper error handling, and follows React Native patterns. The search functionality is particularly well-implemented with fuzzy matching and relevance scoring.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/services/guideContentService.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling in loadGuidesFromJSON to provide more detailed error messages
  - **Why**: Better debugging experience when guide loading fails
  - **How**: Added specific error context and validation before processing guides

- **File**: src/services/guideContentService.ts
  - **Change**: Improved image preloading with deduplication and better error handling
  - **Why**: Prevent duplicate network requests and handle failures gracefully
  - **How**: Used Set for deduplication and Promise.allSettled for robust error handling

- **File**: src/services/guideContentService.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed static method call and improved hash generation algorithm
  - **Why**: Correct method invocation and more reliable hash generation
  - **How**: Used proper DJB2 hash algorithm with consistent output format

- **File**: src/utils/guideValidator.ts
  - **Change**: Added media reference validation for imageUrl and videoUrl
  - **Why**: Ensure complete validation coverage for all guide properties
  - **How**: Added type checking for optional media URLs in step validation

- **File**: src/utils/searchIndexer.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced fuzzy matching with word boundary detection
  - **Why**: Improve search accuracy for partial word matches
  - **How**: Added word boundary matching before expensive Levenshtein calculation

- **File**: src/storage/guidesStorage.ts
  - **Change**: Removed dependency on non-existent StorageService methods
  - **Why**: Fix incorrect API usage that would cause runtime errors
  - **How**: Used AsyncStorage directly with proper JSON serialization

- **File**: src/store/slices/guidesSlice.ts
  - **Change**: Added selectGuideById and selectIsGuideBookmarked selectors
  - **Why**: Common access patterns that were missing from the slice
  - **How**: Added memoized selectors following Redux best practices

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript 5.3+ compliance, proper typing throughout
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns, services/utils/storage organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria successfully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Enhanced error handling in GuideContentService for better debugging
[x] Improved image preloading performance with deduplication
[x] Fixed hash generation for consistent content versioning
[x] Added missing media validation in GuideValidator
[x] Optimized fuzzy search matching algorithm
[x] Fixed storage layer to use correct AsyncStorage API
[x] Added commonly needed Redux selectors
[ ] Consider implementing image lazy loading for large guide lists
[ ] Add telemetry for search query analytics
[ ] Consider caching search index in AsyncStorage for faster app startup

### Security Review

No security issues found. Guide content is properly validated and sanitized. No user input is directly rendered without validation.

### Performance Considerations

- Search indexing is efficient with O(n) build time and fast lookups
- Image preloading uses Promise.allSettled to prevent blocking on failures
- Fuzzy matching optimized to avoid expensive calculations for long strings
- Storage layer properly handles size limits (10MB max)

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation is solid with good architecture, comprehensive testing, and proper error handling. All refactoring has been completed to improve code quality. The remaining unchecked items are future enhancements that don't block the current story.
