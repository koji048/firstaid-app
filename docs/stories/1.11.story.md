# Story 1.11: Offline Support and Data Synchronization

## Story Information

**Epic**: 1 - MVP Core Features  
**Story Number**: 1.11  
**Title**: Offline Support and Data Synchronization  
**Status**: Ready for Development

## Story Statement

**As a** user,  
**I want** the app to work offline and sync data when connected,  
**So that** I can access critical first aid information and emergency contacts even without internet connection.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Core app functionality works offline
2. Emergency contacts accessible without internet
3. First aid guides available offline
4. Data synchronization when connection restored
5. Offline status indicator for users
6. Cached data management with storage limits

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies

Story 1.11 builds upon:

- Story 1.8: Emergency contacts system with Redux state management
- Story 1.9: Emergency mode functionality and hospital location services
- Story 1.10: Navigation system and home screen quick actions

Required components from previous stories:
- Emergency contacts at `/src/store/slices/contactsSlice.ts`
- First aid guides system at `/src/store/slices/guidesSlice.ts`
- Emergency mode state at `/src/store/slices/emergencySlice.ts`
- Navigation state management at `/src/store/slices/navigationSlice.ts`

### Technology Stack

[Source: README.md tech stack]:
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage & SQLite for offline data persistence
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for caching
- **Framework**: React Native 0.73+ with TypeScript
- **Network**: NetInfo for connection status monitoring
- **Background Sync**: React Native background tasks

### Offline Architecture Requirements

Based on mobile app best practices:

```typescript
// Offline data structure
interface OfflineState {
  isOnline: boolean;
  lastSyncTimestamp: number;
  pendingSyncActions: Action[];
  cachedData: {
    contacts: EmergencyContact[];
    guides: FirstAidGuide[];
    hospitals: Hospital[];
    userProfile: UserProfile | null;
  };
  storageUsage: {
    used: number;
    limit: number;
    percentage: number;
  };
}
```

### Storage Strategy

1. **Critical Data (Always Cached)**:
   - Emergency contacts
   - Basic first aid guides
   - User medical profile
   - Emergency mode settings

2. **Optional Data (Cache with Limits)**:
   - Detailed guide images and videos
   - Hospital location data
   - User preferences and settings
   - Navigation history

3. **Temporary Data (Session Only)**:
   - Search results
   - Current location data
   - Real-time emergency status

### Synchronization Strategy

**Sync Triggers**:
- App becomes active with internet connection
- User explicitly triggers sync
- Background sync when app is backgrounded
- Periodic sync every 30 minutes when active

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Last-write-wins for user data
- Server authority for guide content
- User confirmation for critical emergency data conflicts

### UI Design Requirements

Following IBM design system established in previous stories:

- **Offline Indicator**: Non-intrusive banner at top of screen
- **Sync Status**: Progress indicator during synchronization
- **Storage Management**: Settings screen with storage usage display
- **Download Management**: User control over what gets cached offline

Colors and styling:
- Offline indicator: `--ibm-warning: #f1c21b` background
- Sync progress: `--ibm-blue: #0f62fe` progress bar
- Storage usage: Visual progress bar with percentage

### Performance Requirements

- App startup time: <3 seconds even with offline data loading
- Offline search: Results within 500ms
- Sync completion: Background sync shouldn't block UI
- Storage efficiency: Compress cached data to minimize storage usage

### Platform Considerations

**iOS Specific**:
- Use iOS background app refresh for sync
- Respect iOS storage management recommendations
- Handle app suspension during sync operations

**Android Specific**:
- Use Android work manager for background sync
- Handle Android battery optimization settings
- Manage storage permissions properly

### Security Requirements

- Encrypt sensitive offline data (medical information, contacts)
- Secure sync transmission with HTTPS/TLS
- Local data encryption using platform keychain
- No sensitive data in plain text storage

## Notes

This story establishes the app's offline capabilities, ensuring users can access critical first aid information and emergency contacts regardless of network connectivity. This is particularly important for emergency scenarios where reliable internet access may not be available.

The implementation must balance storage efficiency with functionality, prioritizing emergency-critical data while providing user control over what gets cached. The synchronization system should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully.

Special attention should be paid to emergency mode offline functionality, as this represents the most critical use case for the application. All emergency features must work reliably without internet connection.

Performance optimization is crucial for offline functionality - users should not experience any degradation in app responsiveness when accessing offline data compared to online operation.
