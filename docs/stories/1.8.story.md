## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.7 implementation:

- Guide browsing and search UI successfully implemented
- Navigation to GuideDetailScreen is configured in GuidesStack
- Redux store has guide state management with currentGuide state
- Guide data structure includes full content with steps, warnings, when_to_call
- High contrast mode toggle available (stored locally in screens)
- Emergency-optimized components with large touch targets established
- GuideContentService loads all 50 guides with complete content

### Guide Data Model

From FirstAidGuide interface [Source: architecture/data-models.md#firstaidguide-model]:

```typescript
interface FirstAidGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: GuideCategory;
  severity: SeverityLevel;
  content: GuideContent;
  searchTags: string[];
  isOfflineAvailable: boolean;
  viewCount: number;
  lastReviewedAt: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface GuideContent {
  summary: string;
  steps: GuideStep[];
  warnings: string[];
  whenToCallEmergency: string[];
}

interface GuideStep {
  order: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  duration?: number; // seconds
}
```

### UI Design Requirements

Based on UI Guidelines [Source: architecture/ui-guideline.md]:

- Sharp corners (no rounded corners) following IBM design philosophy
- Generous spacing: `px-12 py-8` mobile, `px-16 py-12` desktop
- Light typography weights for headlines
- High contrast text (WCAG AAA - 7:1 ratio for emergency mode)
- Minimal color usage - strategic emphasis only
- Clean, data-first design

### Emergency Context Design

For emergency situations, the detail view must:

- Large, easily tappable step navigation (56x56dp minimum)
- High contrast mode support (consistent with browse screens)
- Clear visual hierarchy with step numbers prominently displayed
- One-handed operation for all critical actions
- Minimal cognitive load - show one step at a time option
- Quick access to emergency dial from any step

### Navigation and Screen Location

GuideDetailScreen exists at [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- `/src/screens/guides/GuideDetailScreen.tsx` - Currently a placeholder

Navigation params should receive:

```typescript
type GuideDetailScreenParams = {
  guideId: string;
};
```

### Component Structure

Guide detail components should be organized as:

```
src/components/guides/
├── StepNavigator/
│   ├── StepNavigator.tsx
│   ├── StepNavigator.styles.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── GuideHeader/
│   ├── GuideHeader.tsx
│   ├── GuideHeader.styles.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── StepContent/
│   ├── StepContent.tsx
│   ├── StepContent.styles.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── GuideWarnings/
    ├── GuideWarnings.tsx
    ├── GuideWarnings.styles.ts
    └── index.ts
```

### State Management Integration

Redux slice actions to use [Source: Story 1.7 implementation]:

- `setCurrentGuide(guide)` - Set the guide being viewed
- `toggleBookmark(guideId)` - Add/remove bookmark
- `incrementViewCount(guideId)` - Track guide views
- `addToRecent(guideId)` - Add to recent guides

### Styling and Theme

From theme.ts [Source: /src/styles/theme.ts]:

- Typography scales: largeTitle (34), title1 (28), title2 (22), headline (17), body (17)
- Colors: primary (#007AFF), danger (#FF3B30), success (#34C759)
- Spacing: xs (4), sm (8), md (16), lg (24), xl (32)
- Emergency severity colors from Story 1.7 to maintain consistency

### Share Functionality

For sharing guides:

- Use React Native Share API
- Share format should include: Title, Summary, and app deep link
- Include warning about medical advice disclaimer

### Accessibility Requirements

- Screen reader support with descriptive labels for each step
- Keyboard navigation support for step-by-step movement
- Voice-over announces current step number and total steps
- High contrast mode must apply to all text elements
- Pinch-to-zoom for any images (future enhancement)

### Performance Considerations

- Guide content is already loaded in memory from GuideContentService
- Implement step pre-loading for smooth transitions
- Use React.memo for step components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy load images if added in future

## Testing

### Test File Locations

Following testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Component tests: `/__tests__/components/guides/`
- Screen tests: `/__tests__/screens/guides/`
- Integration tests: `/__tests__/integration/guideDetail.test.ts`

### Testing Standards

- Use React Native Testing Library for component tests
- Mock GuideContentService for unit tests
- Test offline scenarios
- Verify text size adjustment persistence
- Test emergency features thoroughly
- Validate accessibility with automated tools

### Test Coverage Requirements

1. Step navigation flows (forward, backward, swipe)
2. Bookmark functionality and persistence
3. Share content formatting
4. Text size adjustment across all content
5. High contrast mode application
6. Emergency dial integration
7. View count and recent guides tracking
8. Error states and edge cases
9. Accessibility compliance

## Notes

This story implements the guide detail view for displaying the 50 first aid guides created in Story 1.6. The focus is on clear, readable presentation optimized for emergency use with features like step-by-step navigation, text size adjustment, and quick sharing. The implementation must maintain consistency with the emergency-optimized UI patterns established in Story 1.7 while providing a focused, distraction-free reading experience for critical first aid instructions.

Image zoom functionality (AC 3) is partially addressed by creating the infrastructure for future image support, as the current guide content from Story 1.6 does not include images yet.
