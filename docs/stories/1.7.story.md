## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.6 implementation:

- 50 first aid guides successfully created across 8 categories
- Guide content structure and validation system fully implemented
- GuideContentService at `/src/services/guideContentService.ts` handles loading
- Search indexing ready at `/src/utils/searchIndexer.ts`
- Guide data stored at `/assets/guides/content/` with manifest.json
- Categories: basic_life_support, wounds_bleeding, burns_scalds, fractures_sprains, medical_emergencies, environmental_emergencies, poisoning_overdose, pediatric_emergencies

### UI Component Structure

Based on frontend architecture, guide components should be organized as:

```
src/components/guides/
├── GuideCard/
│   ├── GuideCard.tsx
│   ├── GuideCard.styles.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── CategoryCard/
│   ├── CategoryCard.tsx
│   ├── CategoryCard.styles.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── SearchBar/
│   ├── SearchBar.tsx
│   ├── SearchBar.styles.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── GuidePreview/
    ├── GuidePreview.tsx
    ├── GuidePreview.styles.ts
    └── index.ts
```

### Screen Locations

Guide screens already exist at [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- `/src/screens/guides/GuidesListScreen.tsx` - Main categories and list view
- `/src/screens/guides/GuideSearchScreen.tsx` - Search functionality
- `/src/screens/guides/GuideDetailScreen.tsx` - Individual guide view

### State Management

Redux store structure for guides [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]:

```typescript
guides: {
  guides: FirstAidGuide[];        // All loaded guides
  currentGuide: FirstAidGuide | null;
  bookmarks: string[];            // Bookmarked guide IDs
  downloadedGuides: string[];     // Offline available guides
}
```

### Guide Data Model

FirstAidGuide interface [Source: architecture/data-models.md#firstaidguide-model]:

```typescript
interface FirstAidGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: GuideCategory;
  severity: SeverityLevel;
  summary: string; // Max 200 chars for preview
  searchTags: string[];
  isOfflineAvailable: boolean;
  viewCount: number;
  lastReviewedAt: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Search Implementation

- SearchIndexer already implemented at `/src/utils/searchIndexer.ts`
- Supports fuzzy search across title, summary, and searchTags
- Auto-complete should leverage the existing search index

### Category Icons and Colors

Guide categories from implementation:

- `basic_life_support` - Emergency/critical procedures
- `wounds_bleeding` - Wound care
- `burns_scalds` - Burn treatment
- `fractures_sprains` - Bone/joint injuries
- `medical_emergencies` - Heart, stroke, diabetic emergencies
- `environmental_emergencies` - Heat, cold, weather-related
- `poisoning_overdose` - Toxic exposure
- `pediatric_emergencies` - Child-specific emergencies

### Navigation Flow

From React Navigation setup [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]:

```
GuidesStack
├── GuidesListScreen (categories + recent)
├── GuideSearchScreen (search with results)
└── GuideDetailScreen (full guide view)
```

### Offline Indicators

- All 50 guides are bundled with app (isOfflineAvailable: true)
- Future enhancement may allow selective downloading
- UI should show offline badge on guide cards

### Performance Considerations

- Implement virtualized lists for guide browsing (FlatList)
- Lazy load guide content, only load full content on detail view
- Cache search results in memory during session
- Use React.memo for guide card components

## UX Design Review

### Emergency Context Requirements

The UI must be optimized for high-stress emergency situations where users need immediate access to critical information.

#### Visual Hierarchy for Emergency Use

- **High Contrast Mode**: Toggle for emergency visibility (WCAG AAA - 7:1 ratio)
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 48x48dp, ideally 56x56dp for stress situations
- **Color Coding by Severity**:
  - Red: Life-threatening (basic_life_support)
  - Orange: Urgent medical (medical_emergencies)
  - Yellow: Moderate urgency (wounds_bleeding)
  - Blue: Environmental (environmental_emergencies)

#### Enhanced Search Experience

- **Voice Search**: Critical for hands-free or when typing is difficult
- **Smart Error Handling**: Pre-map common misspellings (e.g., "hart attack" → "heart attack")
- **Symptom Aliases**: Map user language to medical terms
- **Predictive Categories**: Show category suggestions above search results
- **Search Bar Design**:
  ```
  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 🔍 "choking, bleeding, burns..." │
  │────────────────────────────────  │
  │ Recent: Choking, CPR, Burn       │
  │                                  │
  │ Try: "chest pain" "can't breathe"│
  └──────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

#### Emergency-Optimized Card Design

```
GuideCard Layout:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [!] SEVERITY │ OFFLINE ✓    │
│                             │
│ Guide Title (Large, Bold)   │
│ Quick summary (2 lines max) │
│                             │
│ [Category] • 3 min read     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Quick Actions Bar

Above categories, add emergency actions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚨 EMERGENCY DIAL │ 📍 SHARE LOCATION │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Accessibility for Panic Situations

- **One-Handed Operation**: All critical actions reachable with thumb
- **Shake to Reset**: Shake device to return to main categories
- **Simple Language**: Grade 6 reading level for summaries
- **Icon + Text**: Never rely on icons alone
- **Haptic Feedback**: Confirm actions with vibration
- **Screen Reader**: Full support with clear announcements

#### Smart Features

- **Most Critical Section**: CPR, choking, severe bleeding at top
- **Context-Aware Sorting**: Based on time, location, recent searches
- **Child Emergency Filter**: Quick toggle for parents
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential info first, details on demand

### UI Framework Decision

After evaluating shadcn/ui and other alternatives, the decision is to **stick with the current React Native Elements + custom StyleSheet approach** for the following reasons:

1. **Stability**: Current setup is proven and reliable for emergency app context
2. **Compatibility**: React Native Elements is designed for mobile, unlike web-focused shadcn/ui
3. **Existing Investment**: Theme system and components are already well-structured
4. **Risk Management**: Refactoring would introduce unnecessary risk to critical emergency features

#### Minor Enhancements to Current Approach

- Create component templates for consistency
- Standardize emergency-specific style presets
- Build internal component documentation
- Focus on emergency-optimized patterns within existing framework

3. Recent/frequent guides tracking
4. Bookmark persistence
5. Offline mode indicators
6. Error states and loading states
7. Performance with large guide lists

## Implementation Priority

Based on the emergency context, implement features in this order:

### Phase 1: Critical Path (Must Have)

1. Large touch targets (56x56dp minimum)
2. High contrast design with clear visual hierarchy
3. Simple 2-tap navigation to any guide
4. Basic search with fuzzy matching
5. Offline indicators
6. Most critical guides section (CPR, choking, severe bleeding)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Emergency Features (Should Have)

1. Voice search integration
2. Quick Actions Bar (Emergency Dial, Share Location)
3. Haptic feedback
4. High contrast mode toggle
5. Smart search with misspelling correction
6. Recent/frequent guides tracking

### Phase 3: Delight Features (Nice to Have)

1. Shake-to-reset gesture
2. Context-aware sorting
3. Advanced filtering options
4. Progressive loading optimizations
5. Animated transitions

## Notes

This story builds the browsing and search UI for the 50 first aid guides created in Story 1.6. The focus is on quick access during emergencies through intuitive categories, smart search with auto-complete, and personalized sections (recent/frequent). All guides are offline-available in the MVP, so the UI should clearly indicate this capability.

The UX design prioritizes emergency use cases with large touch targets, high contrast, and minimal cognitive load. Every design decision should support users in high-stress situations where seconds matter.
