# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for First Aid Room App, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision**: Custom React Native architecture tailored for mobile-first emergency response

- No specific starter template used due to specialized requirements
- Native mobile app architecture (not web-based)
- Custom offline-first design patterns required
- Emergency mode requires custom low-level optimizations
