# First Aid Room App Architecture

This document describes the technical architecture of the First Aid Room mobile application.

## System Overview

The First Aid Room App is a mobile application designed to provide quick access to first aid information and emergency assistance. The system consists of a mobile client application, backend services, and integration with emergency services.

### Key Features
- Emergency contact management
- First aid guide database
- Location-based services
- Offline capability
- Multi-language support

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for application state
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Offline Storage**: AsyncStorage and SQLite

### Backend
- **API Server**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for media assets
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **Container Orchestration**: ECS with Fargate
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and Sentry
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway

## Architecture Patterns

### Client Architecture
The mobile application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and screens
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Redux actions and reducers
3. **Data Access Layer**: API clients and local storage
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Platform-specific implementations

### Server Architecture
The backend follows a microservices architecture:

1. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services
2. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
3. **Content Service**: Manages first aid guides and medical information
4. **Emergency Service**: Handles emergency contacts and alerts
5. **Notification Service**: Manages push notifications

## Data Models

### User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  profile: UserProfile;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  emergencyContacts: EmergencyContact[];
}
```

### Emergency Contact Model
```typescript
interface EmergencyContact {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  relationship: string;
  isPrimary: boolean;
}
```

### First Aid Guide Model
```typescript
interface FirstAidGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: string;
  content: string;
  media: MediaAsset[];
  translations: Translation[];
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email/password or social login
2. Server generates JWT access token (15 min expiry) and refresh token (30 days)
3. Tokens stored securely in device keychain
4. Access token used for API requests
5. Refresh token used to obtain new access token

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Medical data handled according to HIPAA guidelines

## Integration Architecture

### Emergency Services Integration
- **911 Integration**: Direct dial capability with location sharing
- **Hospital API**: Real-time hospital availability and wait times
- **Ambulance Tracking**: Real-time ambulance location updates

### Third-Party Services
- **Maps Integration**: Google Maps for location services
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe for premium features
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics for usage tracking
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging

## Performance Architecture

### Mobile Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of features
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with responsive sizing
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching of static content
- **Bundle Size**: Target < 20MB initial download

### Backend Performance
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries, connection pooling
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: CloudFront for static assets
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on CPU and memory metrics

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Feature branch deployments for testing
- Automated testing pipeline

### Staging Environment
- Mirrors production infrastructure
- Used for QA and user acceptance testing
- Data anonymization from production

### Production Environment
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Automated rollback capability
- Multi-region deployment for high availability

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for error monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: New Relic APM
- **Log Aggregation**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Pingdom for endpoint monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **CloudWatch**: AWS resource monitoring
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for visualization

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
- **File Storage**: S3 versioning and cross-region replication
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure as Code in Git

### Recovery Procedures
- **RTO**: 4 hours for critical services
- **RPO**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Failover**: Automated failover to secondary region
- **Testing**: Quarterly disaster recovery drills
