# Architecture Patterns

## Client Architecture
The mobile application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and screens
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Redux actions and reducers
3. **Data Access Layer**: API clients and local storage
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Platform-specific implementations

## Server Architecture
The backend follows a microservices architecture:

1. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services
2. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
3. **Content Service**: Manages first aid guides and medical information
4. **Emergency Service**: Handles emergency contacts and alerts
5. **Notification Service**: Manages push notifications
